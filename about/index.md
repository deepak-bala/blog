Co-founder and Engineering lead of an award winning product - Konotor. 

I left my cushy job at eBay in 2012 to start a company with [@Vignesh](https://twitter.com/vignesh_giri) (Product head at Zynga) and [@Sri](https://twitter.com/srikrishnang) (Product head at Jigsee). Our product won the Qualcomm Qprize in India. We've since changed the way mobile users and Businesses communicate with each other.
